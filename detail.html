        <h1 class="text-danger">You Will Need</h1>
        <p>* 1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb<br>* 3 tablespoons olive oil<br>* 1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion<br>* 3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)<br>* 2 tablespoons tomato paste<br>* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br>* Pinch crushed red pepper flakes<br>* 1 cup water, broth or dry red wine<br>* 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes<br>* Salt and fresh ground black pepper<br>* Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving<br>* 12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape<br>* 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</p>
        <h1 class="text-danger">Directions</h1>
        <h3>Make Sauce</h3>
        <p>1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.<br>2. Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.<br>3. Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.<br>4. Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</p>
        <h3>Cook Spaghetti</h3>
        <p>1. About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</p>
        <h3>To Finish</h3>
        <p>1. Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</p>
