        <h1 class="text-danger">You Will Need</h1>
        <p>* 4 pounds pork shoulder with the fat left on; use bone-in or boneless<br>* 2 teaspoons fine sea salt<br>* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>* 2 small or 1 medium orange, halved<br>* Half large onion, quartered<br>* 5 cloves garlic<br>* 1 bay leaf<br>* 1 cinnamon stick, broken in half</p>
        <h1 class="text-danger">Directions</h1>
            <h3>Prepare Pork</h3>
            <p>1. Adjust an oven rack towards the lower third of the oven and heat the oven to 300° Fahrenheit.<br>2. Season the pork, on all sides, with two teaspoons salt and one teaspoon pepper.<br>3. Add one tablespoon of oil to a wide, heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pot (like a Dutch oven). See the tips below if you do not have a Dutch oven.<br>4. Place the pork into the pot with the fattiest side facing up.<br>5. Squeeze the oranges over the pork, then place them around the pork.<br>6. Nestle the onion, garlic, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf around the pork.<br>7. Drizzle the remaining two tablespoons of oil over everything.<br>8. Cover the pot with its lid, and then place into the oven until the pork is fork tender, 3 to 3 ½ hours.</p>
             <h3>Shred Pork</h3>
             <p>1. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and cool until you can handle it. Pull the pork with forks or your fingers — pull into larger chunks or shred, depending on your preference. Discard the bone (if there is one), any connective tissue, and larger clumps of fat. I like leaving a few smaller bits of fat.<br>2. Strain the cooking liquid and save it. Discard the onion, oranges, and spices.<br>3. Store the pork and cooking liquid in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve. Both will keep stored in food-safe containers in the fridge for up to four days.</p>
             <h3>To Serve</h3>
             <p>1. Spread the shredded pork on a baking sheet and pour over enough of the saved cooking liquid to moisten the pork. If your cooking liquid has solidified, rewarm some of it in a small saucepan before adding it to the pork.<br>2. Set an oven rack four to five inches below the broiler and turn it on. Slide the pork underneath and broil for 2 to 5 minutes. Stir the pork around once or twice so that the tips of the pork caramelizes. Keep a close eye while it broils; it can burn or smoke quickly.<br>3. Serve carnitas in tacos, burritos, salads, rice, or with your favorite sides.</p>
